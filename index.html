            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              How do scientists classify similar-looking species? In 1936,
              botanist Edgar Anderson collected 150 iris flowers from three
              species. Each looked nearly identical to the naked eye, yet
              belonged to distinct species. This dataset would become the
              foundation for modern machine learning.
            </p>

          <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3>The Complete Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              Here are all 150 flowers plotted by sepal measurements. Do you see
              any patterns? Each dot represents one flower. While they appear
              randomly scattered, mathematical analysis reveals hidden structure
              - the key to automated classification.

            <h3>Classification Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Now here's where it gets interesting! Can you identify what
              species these mystery flowers belong to just by looking at their
              measurements? Click the gold dots to reveal each species and see
              if you can spot the patterns that make classification possible.

            <h3>Species Revealed</h3>
            <p>
              Anderson's measurements revealed distinct clusters! Setosa (red)
              forms a clear group, while Versicolor (green) and Virginica (blue)
              show overlap. This partial separation became the perfect test case
              for classification algorithms - challenging but solvable.

            <h3>Petal Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              When Fisher switched to petal measurements, the separation became
              crystal clear! This insight - that some features are more
              informative than others - became fundamental to feature selection
              in machine learning. Not all data is equally valuable.

          <div class="step" data-step="5">
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p>
              Each species has a distinct mathematical "fingerprint" in their
              average measurements. These statistical patterns enable automated
              classification. This principle now powers everything from medical
              diagnosis to recommendation systems.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="6">
            <h3>The Power of Averages</h3>
            <p>
              These averages reveal each species' mathematical "signature."
              Notice how the average petal length varies dramatically between
              species (1.5cm vs 4.3cm vs 5.6cm), while sepal measurements show
              less variation. This is Fisher's key insight: some
              methods/variables are more useful for classification. This
              principle powers every AI system today, from Netflix
              recommendations to medical diagnosis. Algorithms learn which
              features matter most, just like Fisher discovered that petal
              measurements outperform sepal measurements for identifying iris
              species.

            <h3>Why Consistency Matters</h3>
            <p>
              Medians show us the "typical" flower, unaffected by outliers. One
              striking thing is that the medians do not differ as significantly
              to the averages This consistency makes reliable classification
              possible. When a phone does successful facial recognition in bad
              lighting or medical AI reads X-rays accurately, they rely on this
              same principle: finding patterns that persist despite individual
              variation. The irises sampled proved that nature follows
              predictable mathematical rules.

            <h3>The Legacy Lives On</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>From 150 Flowers to AI Revolution:</strong> This simple
              dataset became the "Hello World" of machine learning. Every time
              you get a movie recommendation, your photo is auto-tagged, or a
              doctor uses AI for diagnosis, you're seeing Fisher's 1936 insights
              in action. The Iris dataset proved that mathematical patterns
              could reveal nature's hidden classifications - a principle that
              now powers our digital world.
