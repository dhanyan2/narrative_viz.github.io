            <h3>🌱 Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome to the famous Iris dataset! This collection contains
              measurements of 150 iris flowers across three species. Each flower
              was measured for petal and sepal dimensions.
            </p>

            <h3>📊 The Complete Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              Here we see all 150 iris flowers plotted by sepal length and
              width. Notice how they form distinct clusters - this is our first
              hint that different species might have different characteristics.

            <h3>🎯 Classification Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Now here's where it gets interesting! Can you identify what
              species these mystery flowers belong to just by looking at their
              measurements? Click the gold dots to reveal each species and see
              if you can spot the patterns that make classification possible.

            <h3>🔍 Species Revealed</h3>
            <p>
              Now we reveal the species! Setosa (red) forms a clear cluster,
              while Versicolor (green) and Virginica (blue) show some overlap.
              This is the classic pattern that makes iris classification
              interesting.

            <h3>📏 Petal Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Switching to petal measurements reveals even clearer separation!
              Petal length and width provide better discrimination between
              species, especially separating Setosa from the others.

            <h3>🎯 Key Insights</h3>
            <p>
              The iris dataset teaches us about natural variation within species
              and the power of multiple measurements. It remains a cornerstone
              example in machine learning and statistics.

            <h3>📊 The Power of Averages</h3>
            <p>
              These averages reveal each species' mathematical "signature."
              Notice how the average petal length varies dramatically between
              species (1.5cm vs 4.3cm vs 5.6cm), while sepal measurements show
              less variation. This is Fisher's key insight: some
              methods/variables are more useful for classification. This
              principle powers every AI system today, from Netflix
              recommendations to medical diagnosis. Algorithms learn which
              features matter most, just like Fisher discovered that petal
              measurements outperform sepal measurements for identifying iris
              species.

            <h3>📊 Why Consistency Matters</h3>
            <p>
              Medians show us the "typical" flower, unaffected by outliers. One
              striking thing is that the medians do not differ as significantly
              to the averages This consistency makes reliable classification
              possible. When a phone does successful facial recognition in bad
              lighting or medical AI reads X-rays accurately, they rely on this
              same principle: finding patterns that persist despite individual
              variation. The irises sampled proved that nature follows
              predictable mathematical rules.
