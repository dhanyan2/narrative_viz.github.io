            <h3>🌱 Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome to the famous Iris dataset! This collection contains
              measurements of 150 iris flowers across three species. Each flower
              was measured for petal and sepal dimensions.
            </p>

            <h3>📊 The Complete Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              Here we see all 150 iris flowers plotted by sepal length and
              width. Notice how they form distinct clusters - this is our first
              hint that different species might have different characteristics.

            <h3>🔍 Species Revealed</h3>
            <p>
              Now we reveal the species! Setosa (red) forms a clear cluster,
              while Versicolor (green) and Virginica (blue) show some overlap.
              This is the classic pattern that makes iris classification
              interesting.

            <h3>📏 Petal Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Switching to petal measurements reveals even clearer separation!
              Petal length and width provide better discrimination between
              species, especially separating Setosa from the others.

            <h3>🎯 Key Insights</h3>
            <p>
              The iris dataset teaches us about natural variation within species
              and the power of multiple measurements. It remains a cornerstone
              example in machine learning and statistics.

            <h3>📊 Average Sepal/Petal Measurements</h3>
            <p>
              Let's examine the mean values for sepal and petal lengths! This
              bar chart shows the mean and median values for sepal and petal
              lengths across the three species. Notice how petal length shows
              greater variation between species than sepal length. We can come
              to a conclusion about Setosa and Virginica's measurements.
            </p>

            <h3>📊 Median Sepal/Petal Measurements</h3>
            <p>
              Now let's look at the median values! Medians are less affected by
              outliers than means, giving us a different perspective on the
              typical flower measurements. Notice how the median values compare
              to the averages we just saw. Setosa and Virginica also show
              consistency in their measurements here as well.
